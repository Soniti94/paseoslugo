The AI engineer's work on the Lugo Tailwags dog walking app started from a Figma draft, progressing through several key phases. Initially, the core FastAPI, React, and MongoDB application was built, incorporating Google Maps and Stripe integrations after user clarifications and API key provision. The first major update addressed user feedback to restrict registration to clients only and implemented a new footer design. Subsequently, a featured walker, Sonia Sánchez, was added with a custom badge and profile. A significant effort was then dedicated to making the entire application fully responsive across mobile and tablet devices, followed by a minor footer simplification.

A critical phase involved fixing a non-responsive header on mobile, requiring extensive CSS and component logic adjustments to ensure the hamburger menu and navigation links functioned correctly. After a successful deployment readiness check and subsequent fixes for warnings (e.g., hardcoded URLs), the engineer embarked on a large set of new features. This included a Rover-style hero section with a booking box, multi-language support (i18n), client profile pages, legal pages, and backend logic for booking cancellations and payments. This phase involved considerable debugging for frontend compilation errors, blank page issues, and missing component imports. The current task involves addressing user requests to translate authentication/registration dialog fields by updating the  file.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing user feedback regarding the translation of authentication and registration dialogs. The user specifically requested that fields like profile.password and buttons such as Iniciar sesión, Crear cuenta, and Iniciar sesión con Google be displayed in Spanish by default, with the ability to change via the language selector.

The AI engineer identified that the  file was missing the necessary keys for these specific authentication texts. The last completed action was the successful modification of  to include the required Spanish translations for these elements. The engineer is now preparing to restart the frontend to apply these changes and verify them visually.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Restart the frontend service (frontend: ERROR (not running)
frontend: started) and then take a screenshot of the authentication/registration dialogs to verify that the texts are now correctly displayed in Spanish.
